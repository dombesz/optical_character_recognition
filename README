This application was written in Java and the main scope was to represent the multi layer neurons applicability in optical character recognition. This application recognizes hand written digits. The network learns the digits from input samples, after that he will be able to recognize written digits. The learning procedure was created with backpropagation algorithm. The application was created with representing purposes and in this form is not really efficient in recognizing large amount of digits and cannot be applied in practice(For example: recognizing digits from a picture file). With this application we can understand how the neural network works in recognition of digits.
